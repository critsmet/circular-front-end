# Circular: The Front End

Circular is still in the initial stages of ideation/first-draft development by Chris Metzger and [Jesse Hlebo](jessehlebo.com). Circular seeks to create a community-driven event sharing platform that encourages bonding IRL instead of online. Check out the screen recording below for a demo, and [this](https://github.com/critsmet/circular-back-end/tree/day-view) link to the back end repository. Hop around the branches to see features that are still being built and have not been merged to master.

Circular's front end was boostrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
